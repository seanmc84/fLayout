    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>
      This is one of my first actual webpages That I have created. I enjoy making websites because it allows me to use
      creativity, which i normally lack. I am not sure what the requirements are for this project, so I am going to make
      it simple, but also a little creative. I am still learning how to do a lot of the css formatting so I am not able
      to make it perfect. I tried to do my best on this website without over-working myself, so that is all I care about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made websites before, I even took 2 classes in high school for web development. Those were some of the only
      computer courses in my high school, so I was interested in learning them. I pick up well once I am taught a few
      times how to use the formatting. In high school, students actually paid me to make their website projects because
      I always finished mine on the first day and they were stuck doing it for the rest of the week. Of course, I took
      advantage of this opportunity and made a few hundred dollars throughout the year by charging $5 a web page. The
      teacher eventually caught on and I took a few points off of my grade and the other students got 0's. In the end, I
      still ended with an A in the class and a few hundred dollars richer, even though it wasn't right to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would definitely like to learn how to efficiently code websites so I can do what you suggested and make webpages
      on my free time. Currently, with the amount of projects I have in school, I don't have much free time. If I was
      able to make one website a week or something for some extra cash, that would be amazing. Doing this would also
      help build a profile for myself that would provide me with enough experience to come out of college with a decent
      career path.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am running out of things to say, but I do enjoy this class as you know that standardized tests do nothing to
      help students learn. I prefer doing projects to force me to learn exactly everything I need to know in order to
      create a working web page. The more projects I do, the more I feel like I am actually learning how to do specific
      things. Specifically, if we are told to make a website a certain way and focus on few main components, that would
      help me learn how everything should be made. I really dont understand the F and Z layout fully, so I am not sure
      what you want me to do with this website. But I assume you just want us to create a simple website that follows
      your sample layout. Which I feel that I have done here.
