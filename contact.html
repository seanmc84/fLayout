      Another project I am working on is to code a website for myself. One of my professors last semester said that you
      should always create a website for yourself to have contact information, projects you have worked on, projects you
      are working on and just general information about who you are and what you do. Basically that is what I am going
      to use this project as an opportunity to get started on. I have created enough information about myself, I just
      need to clean it up and make it look nicer, maybe with some more color and pictures. Again, I don't have much free
      time to get too specific with anything so I don't want to go overboard. I would rather just create a simple layout
      that I can follow and fix it up to make it look nice in the end. Since this project didn't really have guidelines
      other than to follow the F-layout, I don't want to go crazy trying to build a full web page. There is not much
      else I can write anymore and I don't know what you are expecting. I missed class the day this is due so if you
      explained anything there, I am at a loss. It is partially my fault for setting an alarm for the wrong time.
