    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Sean Conroy. I am an Information Systems major at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I enjoy
      playing video games in my free time and coding websites! I am from Manahawkin, New Jersey where I have lived for
      the past 18 years. There is not much to do in that town, so it was pretty boring. Most of my friends also enjoy
      playing video games, and we prefer to do that over most other activities, since there is nothing else to do. I
      enjoy coding websites and would like to learn how to do it better. Once I learn how to do it better I will start
      making a small part-time job out of it to obtain extra spending cash for upgrading my computer and paying my car
      payments. If I look for anything in this class, it is to teach me how to be the most efficient website coder I can
      be.

      I previously have not had much experience with coding before coming to NJIT. I took a few courses, as mentioned on
      the home page, that taught me small bits of html coding. It was very basic and easy for me to grasp on to, so I
      don't think it helped me learn much. My previous work experience has not really helped me at all either. I have
      only worked two other jobs, both being in retail. I worked at an ice cream shop as my first job at 16 until my
      senior year in highschool. When I was a senior, I learned how much my friends were making at other jobs in town,
      and realized I was being severely underpayed for the amount of time I put into that place. I moved to a local
      grocery store on Long Beach Island that year while also still working my job at the ice cream store. I figured out
      that the grocery store would pay me almost 1.5 times as much as the other place and give me more hours to work
      like I wanted. What really bothered me was the ice cream store had given two promotions out that year, and I was
      not one of them. My boss always saw me as one of her best employees and I had been there for 3 years, the second
      longest out of all the employees. Yet, she still gave a raise/promotion to a girl that had just started that year.
      That was the final straw, so I quit that place and starting working full-time at the grocery store. The first
      couple months working there I went from $9.50 an hour to $11.00 an hour. That was a huge upgrade from the ice
      cream shop, espeically with how many hours i get to work now. Today, after 3 years working there I am up to $15.25
      and hour and it is still rising. I am proud of the work I have done and my boss tells me I am essential for the
      business, since I work so many hours. In the summer I would work 60+ hours a week because they loved having me
      there to help them run the business. I am now considered a manager of the deli and stocking sections of the store.
      Next summer they are getting a new Point of Sales system and they are putting me in charge of it. Now I can
      finally use this as something to put on my resume that is related to my career path.

      I play video games on a desktop PC, but also have a laptop that is capable of running most games. I occasionally
      play on an Xbox One as well because I still have friends that like to play on console. This can become an
      expensive hobby because a lot of the time I have to buy the same game on PC and Xbox. I also need to buy
      accessories and upgraded parts for both systems. This is why I am looking for a job to do on the side that can
      help me pay for small things when I need them. For example, this week my desktop actually crashed and I then
      realized that my RAM cards has shorted out. I was forced to spend another $150 to buy new RAM cards in order to
      use my desktop. It is almost like owning a car, you never know when something is going to break, but if something
      does, you have to be ready to fix it. Having a job to help gather extra spending cash would be great. Especially
      if I can also build a portfolio for myself so I can show I have experience. I wish that I could pick up on things
      easier so I can just start coding professionally. I could also spend more time teaching myself, but that is not
      what I came to college to do. I would rather enjoy my time in college to do things I want to do before I have to
      crack down on finding a job. I know that goes against what you explained in class, but my young years are
      important to me, once I lose it, I know it will be gone. I like money too much to focus on gaming, so I know once
      I get into a real job, I will pour my heart into that career. This makes it hard to build portfolios and gain
      experience now, because I would rather just play video games now and enjoy life traveling the world later. I will
      work my ass off to get to that point once I am ready, and I have a few plans on how I am going to get there.
