    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
      As I said on the previous pages, I am not too developed in my skills so I dont have too many projects I am working
      on. One project that I have started is helping rebuilt the website for the company that I work for. Their website
      is not the best, and the owner used to be a web developer teacher. I think his knowledge of advertisement and
      website development has been outdated. I have not told him yet, but I am planning a rebuild of his website with my
      new knowledge of F and Z layout and other findings. I am still unsure whether I will code everything myself, it
      depends on what I get out of this class. If I learn enough to make the website look professional, I will code the
      whole website myself to have a better layout and then show my boss. He always tells me that he hopes I will return
      after college to help them out, and I think rebuilding their website would be a start. This project can also help
      me on a resume by giving the companies I apply for a visual of what I am capable of. I think my boss would love
      this idea, even though I am stepping on his toes calling the website he built bad. It just is not easy to navigate
      and the design is poorly spaced out and aligned. Here is the link to the current web site:
      http://neptunemarketlbi.com/. While it actually looks like he fixed some mistakes I mentioned to him before, there
      is still room to edit some of the page to be more appealing.

      Another project I am working on is to code a website for myself. One of my professors last semester said that you
      should always create a website for yourself to have contact information, projects you have worked on, projects you
      are working on and just general information about who you are and what you do. Basically that is what I am going
      to use this project as an opportunity to get started on. I have created enough information about myself, I just
      need to clean it up and make it look nicer, maybe with some more color and pictures. Again, I don't have much free
      time to get too specific with anything so I don't want to go overboard. I would rather just create a simple layout
      that I can follow and fix it up to make it look nice in the end. Since this project didn't really have guidelines
      other than to follow the F-layout, I don't want to go crazy trying to build a full web page. There is not much
      else I can write anymore and I don't know what you are expecting. I missed class the day this is due so if you
      explained anything there, I am at a loss. It is partially my fault for setting an alarm for the wrong time.
